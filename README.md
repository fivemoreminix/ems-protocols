# EMS Protocols

Use [issues](/issues) for bug tracking, features, and general development updates. We can include discussions and cross reference other issues. Issues can also be tracked in milestones.

## Technologies in use
 * Firebase for user authentication and user data storage (database)
 * Stripe for payment handling, but only on the web version and for owner accounts
